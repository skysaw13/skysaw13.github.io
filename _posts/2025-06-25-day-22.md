what_i_learned: |
  Today I worked more on scaling the data. Yesterday I started exploring data normalization, but it was not working with the data because of the huge spread range among the values for each sample. So today I learned about quantile notmalization, which is a statistical methid used to adjust the distributions of values in different datasets so they have similar shapes and statistical properties. This method is great to use for our project because it is useful for comparing gene expression. This method maps expression values to a common distribution, improving model performance.

blockers: |
  Today, my only blocker today was trying to properly scale my data. I was having trouble making sure that it worked properly because I was getting a lot of weird graph visualizations. I will continue to work on it to get the accurate outcome.
  
reflection: |
  Overall, today was an okay day. I was able to discover the quantile normalization method that works perfectly with gene expression analysis. After scaling the dataset with the quantile normalization method I had to compare the the original dataset and the scaled one to observe the differences. Unfortunately, I have been having trouble obtaining graphs that properly idnetify the data according to the specific gene, but I will continue to work on it.
