what_i_learned: |
  Today, we started off by going to the business building and the writing center cam to teach us a few things about writing a literature review. They gave us several tips and interacted with us to keep us engaged by doing several activities. It was very informative and Dr. Pandey was very nice. Once we returned to the labs we continued to work on our machine learning algorithms to get better results. The highest we have gotten so far is .81 with random forest.

blockers: |
  Today, my only blocker has been trying to find the best model to use to get the best accuracy. Again we have hit a block because we have not been able to increase the accuracy to anything over .81.
  
reflection: |
  Overall, today was a pretty informative day. We learned a lot of new tips from the writing center and it was highly informative. We are still trying increase our accuracy. It has been super fustrating because we all are getting around the same value and we have tried so many ways of altering either the paremeters or just trying different combinations of several models and methods. I was hoping that we would be able to get some type of improvement by the end of this week, but it is not looking like we will be able to.
