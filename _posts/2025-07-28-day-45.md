what_i_learned: |
  Today, we worked consistently on our presentation slides. Ato and Arpana created a nice theme/layout for our slides which will look good to the audience. We all worked on an indivisual slide while discussing ideas together. We are about 90% done. We will probably finish up tomorrow by incorporating the video demo and then we should be good. 

blockers: |
  Today, I have no blockers.
  
reflection: |
  Today, was a productive day. We basically finished the slides for the presentation. We just have to add our video demo and fix any grammatic errors and then we are done, so we will probably finish up tomorrow. We have finished our literature review for the most part. It is just a matter of going back over and identifying any mistakes which I worked on some today. We also got our checks today so it has been a great Monday!
