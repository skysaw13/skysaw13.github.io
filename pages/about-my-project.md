project_title: "Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Predict Genetic Biomarkers of Brain Tumor from Transcriptomic Data Set"

problem: |
  
    Genetic Biomarkers are crucial in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Identifying genetic biomarkers allows for more accurate diagnosis and classification of cancer. The key issues being addressed include the high genetic variability of cancer across patients, the complexity of analyzing large-scale genomic data, and the challenge of translating research findings into practical clinical applications. Overcoming these obstacles is essential for accurately identifying biomarkers that can improve diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized treatment.

approach: |
  The project follows a four-phase pipeline:

    - To learn to use machine learning models in human health by using genomics and transcriptomic data
    - To classify brain tumors based on their genetic markers
    - To develop an ML model to predict the disease risk of brain tumors, whether they are cancerous or non-cancerous
    - To validate their findings with the available resources

    We will use different machine learning algorithms - Random forest, Naive Bayes, Support, vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), LASSO, and Ridge.

outcome: |
  Participants will gain experience in data gathering, machine learning, and deep learning
techniques for Transcriptomic datasets, such as finding and collecting data from different
sources and concatenating them, choosing appropriate ML algorithms to train and test data,
and evaluating the best-fit model for prediction, select a statistical method for validation,
feature selection, and dimensionality reduction. The knowledge will be used to classify the
genes responsible for benign and malignant brain tumors.
