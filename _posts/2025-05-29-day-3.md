what_i_learned: |
  Today Mr. Kelly was able to teach us about Computer vision. I was not familiar with this before so it was very interesting. We then went into our breakout rooms for the python classes and Micheal taught us about File I/O, which consisted of reading, writing, and appending in files. He then gave us assignments to practice what we learned.
 

blockers: |
   The first challenge of today was during the escape room. It was pretty difficult as my team was very confused. My next challenge was caused by trying to complete my file i/o assignment because my user input was not saving to text file.
   
reflection: |
  Today was another good day and a lot was learned. I am getting more and more excited about the future of this internship. Learning about computer vision was probably my favorite part of today as I have never heard of it before. I would love to use teachable machines again in the future.
