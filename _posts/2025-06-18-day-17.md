what_i_learned: |
  Today we were introduced to our High school teacher mentor, Mr. Richard, and he is the best. He teaches at Mervo which is a school a lot of my friends and family went to. He is a chemistry teacher and he is a Doctor, but he prefers to go by Mr. instead of Dr. When we came back from break we got back to work on the data cleaning. I completed all of the data cleaning for the datasets that we have collected, but when I went to combine the datasets there was not enough data to use once we removed the "NAN" values. This meant that Arpana had to find more data to use and I have to clean more data to add to the current amount which is super fustrating.
  

blockers: |
  My blocker for today was the fact that when I thought that we were all done collecting data and I combined everything I found out that I did not have enough data to use, so we have to continue to look for me data and I have to clean more data. I thought that we would be able to start training the model, but I was wrong, so that is very fustrating.
  
reflection: |
  Today was a good day. The enrichment block was not as fun as last week's, but Dr. Mack did inform us on a lot of things and the upcoming events. We played a little game to guess the importance of specofic items and that was a little cool and then we met our HS teacher mentor and he is great. I can see us having a pretty good bond by the time that this is over. I wish I was done collecting data, but we have to find more which means that I have to clean more. Thankfully, we have a day off tomorrow, but we are right back at it this Friday.
