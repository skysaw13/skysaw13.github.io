what_i_learned: |
  Today, was a pretty frustrating day. Dr. Paudel came in today and he basically said we were collecting the wrong datasets, so we spent most of the time learning what exactly he wanted us to do. We have to look more into brain cells (normal tissue vs tumor tissue) as well as if the the tumor genes are cancerous or non-cancerous, so we had to go back and do a little more research. The datasets that we have we can use, but I have to re-clean them and make sure we have the necessary data that is needed to complete the analysis.  

blockers: |
  The blocker for today was finding out that we don’t have the correct data, which is so frustrating because I had just finished cleaning all of our data and combining it, but I can’t stay down about it. I just have to redo everything to get started on our model.
  
reflection: |
  Overall, today sucked for the most part. I still can’t believe I basically did all of that work for nothing, but the practice helped and since I am already familiar with the data cleaning process it shouldn’t take me as long to clean the new data. I hope this time we stay on track. Dr. Paudel said that he would be in either Monday or Tuesday to check on our progress. I just feel like this pushed us back like crazy especially with the presentation coming up in a week.
