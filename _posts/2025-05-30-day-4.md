what_i_learned: |
  Today, we jumped right into our Python breakout rooms where Michael continued the lesson on File I/O. He continued to explain to us what readlines do and how we can utilize them in code. We then proceeded to complete a series of assignments to practice these methods while incorporating some of the methods that we learned previously like sets, list and dictionaries. After lunch, Cldye taught us about Gen AI and LLM's. He started off by breaking down the different types of AI, which consisted of artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and Gen AI.

   I would say my only challenge today occured during the lesson in Python102. Our very last assignments was a bit difficult for me as I kept running into errors.
   
reflection: |
  Overall today was another great day. My favorite part of today was during Clyde's presentation on on Gen AI and LLm's. It was super informative and the activities made it more entertaining. I like the kahoots it kept the lesson interactive which motivates more people to engage. I also liked the poll activity that we did towards the end. It keeps us engaged and allows us to interact with our peers.
