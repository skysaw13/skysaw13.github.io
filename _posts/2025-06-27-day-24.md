what_i_learned: |
  Today I came in thinking that I was making very good progress until Dr. Paudel came in to visit us. He said that we were making good progress, but when he further analyzed our code there was a mistake, so I basically had to scratch the Pearson and Spearman Correlation idea because it was not providing the accurate information. When using those methods they prioritize using the Absolute Value correlation which threw off our data, so now I am forced to explore more options. I have been reading a few articles and some of the most common feature selection methods were SVM, MRMR, and PCA. I tried MRMR yesterday, but the runtime for that algorithm was very long. The code was still being executed after an hour and there were still 4 more lines of code, so I decided to move on from that and find a quicker method. So far PCA and SVM have given me promising results and I have sent the results to Dr. Paudel to make sure that I am on the right path.

  Today, my blocker was finding out the Pearson and Spearman Correlation Coefficient methods did not work well with our dataset as the absolute value representation was throwing off our data accuracey. It was looking good until Dr. Paudel identified this problem. I am just getting super fustrated with the fact that every time I beileve I have made significant progress something always goes wrong and I am back to square one. To solve this reoccuring problem for now on I will be sending Dr. Paudel updates through emails to recieve feedback since he only comes here once a week. It is getting too close to the end to keep makin g mistakes like this.
  
reflection: |
  Overall, today was an okay day. Although, I was not able to use the Pearson and Spearman methods like I thought I would be able too, so that is very fustrating. I have tried different methods now, so hopefully Dr. Paudel agrees on them and I can move on to begin training and testing the model. I know I still have more than enough time, but I personally do not like to not make progress everyday. It makes me highly irritated with myself because I feel like I am holding the team back.
