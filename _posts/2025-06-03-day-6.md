what_i_learned: |
  Today we continued to just read on things that we need to know to prepare for the project. We worked more on Python today. I am familiar with majority of the content that we went over, but review is always appreciated. Since some of my group members arent computer science majors we went over things like list, list comprehension, etc. As Dr. Paudel was showing us code he did demonstrate something in one of his print statements that was new for me. He showed us how to use an f-string to convert our print statement to basically accept all string values including accepting the interger value. I also went through and learned more on Machine Learning which is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics and things that can be done using Machine Learning. 

blockers: |
   There were no blockers today as we just continued to read and review Python and Machine Learning.
   
reflection: |
  Overall, today was a heavy reading day, which I dont mind. For myself, mostly everything that we went over I was familiar with aside from the machine learning. We were instructed to complete some Python practices on Kaggle which I am looking forward to doing. I can appreciate all of the review as some of these Python concepts I have not had to utilize in a while.
