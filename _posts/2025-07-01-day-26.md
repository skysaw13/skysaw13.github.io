what_i_learned: |
  Today we continued to look at different methods that we could potentially use to help better our accuracy. I tried so many different options such as altering the feature selection methods, altering the machine learning algorithm, and trying different ways of scaling the data. This process has become very fustrating because I feel like we arent making any progress and it were not getting the results that we want. The accuracy has not gone past 79 no matter what I have tried. I am starting to feel like it is the dataset, but even so I have already scaled the data so that it is in a specific range.

  Today, my blocker was trying to find the right algorithm and methods to use to get better results. This has been an ongoing problem and it is insanely fustrating because I need to figure this out by tomorrow.
  
reflection: |
  Overall, today was highly fustrating. I have gotten to the point where I am just moving in pure fustration since we can not get the results that we are looking for. I am not opposed to using what we have so far on the presentation, but I am just trying to improve our results a little more and I will feel a bit more comfortable to present. I am hoping things change by tomorrow before lunch, so we can finish the slides and get this over with.
