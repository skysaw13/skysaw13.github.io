what_i_learned: |
  To begin class, Mr. Kelly introduced us to what Computer Vision is and the 4 main computer vision task which are image classification, object detection, object tracking, and image segmentation. He broke down why is it important and how it works. We then went on to break into our Python groups and Michael gave us an assignment from our review and then went on to teach us abour File I/O. We learned about writing, reading, and appending in a file 
as well as applying it as we did another assignment for practice.

  My first challenge of today was during the escape room. It took my group a while to connect the clues. We werent even able to complete it before the lunch break. My next challenge was during the Python102 class. I was having trouble getting my user input to show up in one of my text files, but after messing with it for a little bit I was able to fix it. 
reflection: |
  Today, was another great day. We learned about Computer Vision which I had never heard of before today and it was very eye opening especially when we were putting example of what it is in the chat. Although, the escape room was challenging it was still a good bonding experience with my group. Michael went over file I/O with us today which was a great refresher because I havent done those methods in a while. I came across a few challenges during the assignment portion, but I was able to overcome them.
