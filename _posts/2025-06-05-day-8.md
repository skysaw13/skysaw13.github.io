what_i_learned: |
  Today was another heavy read day as well as python coding. We were tasked to complete the intro for Python on Kaggle. For me I am already familair with these things, but it is great practice. We also would work on completing different codes throughout the day and seeing everyone come up with different solutions for the problems was very informative as we discussed why and how we came up with it.

blockers: |
   There were no blockers today as we just continued to read and work on Kaggle for more practice on Python.
   
reflection: |
  Overall, today was another heavy reading day. We also worked on Kaggle , which I can appreciate for the additional practice and review. Tomorrow we are going to start discussing some of the math concepts that we will be using to complete the project which I am looking forward to.
