what_i_learned: |
  Today we started by finding more data sets to add to our overall set. We have been struggling to increase our accuracy and we have tried to use some many different techniques, methods, and models to improve our classification report, but we have not had much luck. We are stuck between 75 and 80. My group mates have not been able to find anything so far, so I started working on our methodology part of our literature review in the mean time. I have just started discussing the cleaning and transposing of the data as well as listing the GSE datasets that we have found.

blockers: |
  Today, I would not neccesarily say that I had a blocker, but I was a bit fustrated waiting for my group mates to find more datasets for me to clean and add to our overall total. They kept refinding datasets that we have already used. I even sent them the ones that we have and told them not to send them if they match, but it seems like they were just not listening and continued to send the same one. I am just ready to move on to complete this project.
  
reflection: |
  Overall, today was a okay. My group mates were tasked to find more datasets for me to clean and I just worked on the methodology for our literature review. It was a pretty chill day, but I do wish there was more productivity as far as finding the datasets because we could have been farther along, but hopefully we have better luck tomorrow. I just want to improve the overall accuracy of of our predictions so we can finish up this project. We are so close to the end of the finish line, so I am hoping this week we make some serious improvements.
