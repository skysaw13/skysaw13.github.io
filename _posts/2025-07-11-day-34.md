  Today, we got right back into trying to improve our accuracy. My highest accuracy has come from using Random Forest and LightGBM which has both been .81. Today, Dr. Paudel came in with us a for a while and just observed our progress so far. He said that we are on a good track so far and that our .81 accuracy is good, but ideally we want to get to .88-.90 accuracy if possible. Some other recommendations that he gave us was to try to use a 20/80 train test split, try removing outliers, and try changing our scaling methods. I did try all the things he suggested and the only things that improved my accuracy was changing the scaling method to quantile normalization and removing outliers after scaling my data. This resulted in my accuracy moving to .82! It is not much improvement, but I will take it.

  Today, my only blocker has been trying to improve my accuracy from my Random Forest model. With the advice from Dr. Paudel I was able to improve my accuracy from .81 to .82 which I am happy about, but we need a little more.
  
reflection: |
  Overall, today was a pretty good day. Dr. Paudel's visit made me feel a bit better about our progress because I have been very fustrated with our progress, but with this slight improvement I now know that it is possible to improve our accuracy. I have been doing a lot of research to observe other methods and steps that led to other's research having higher accuracy that is somewhat in the same area as our project, but so far no matter what combinations I havent had much luck. I do believe we might have to look for some more data just because I cannot identify what could be causing this low accuracy. I just hope that we have better luck next week.
