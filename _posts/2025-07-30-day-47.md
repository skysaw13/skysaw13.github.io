what_i_learned: |
  Today, we finished up our presentation slides. We finished any additional fixes and we practiced how we would present and basically spent the whole day doing that. They are looking great. We also did a bonding experience by having a pot luck to end the last day of the lab.

  Today, I have no blockers.
  
reflection: |
  Today, we completed our presentation slides. We had a great last day of working in the labs together. We went out of our way to do a bonding activity by completing a pot luck to incorporate our different cultures since everyone is from different places. I am going to miss this group.
