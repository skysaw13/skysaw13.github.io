what_i_learned: |
  Today, I played Taboo for the first time during the cohort enrichment. It was hard trying to give guesses and avoid saying the words that were on the card. When we came back to the lab we dove right back into researching for our literature review. As I was researching I did learn alot more techniques that will allow us to have gene selection models. Some other techniques that I learned were Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR),SMOTE, Oversampling/Undersampling, and more which we can potential integrate within our code. TJ then showed us a code and explained how each portion contibutes to the model and we were able to get an idea of what we will be having to do. Another thing that I began to learn today is cleaning the data that we will be using for our project. TJ assigned me to do it which I am excited for because I can utilize this in my career.
blockers: |
   My blocker for today was going up and playing Taboo. I did not want to go up there because I knew I would have a hard time trying to give hints for my team and I did struggle, but we did get two points from it, so I cannot complain. Another small blocker was when I was starting to clean the data it was a learning process because I have never done that before.
   
reflection: |
  Overall, today was a great day. The first 3 hours was probably the most fun I have had since the program started. It was a great way to allow us to come together and hang out. I look forward to the rest of the cohort enrichment plans! When we got back to the lab we jumped right into working on our lit review and now I am responsible for the methodlogy and cleaning the data which I am really looking forward to. I thought that we were a bit behind as far as progress since we had to spend so much time on practicing python, but it seems like for the most part everyone is in the same space. I am just ready to really get going on the progress and I believe we are making great strides.
