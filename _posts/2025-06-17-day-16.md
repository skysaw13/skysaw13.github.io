what_i_learned: |
    Today, was another busy day. Again, I have spent the day cleaning and transposing data. I was still stuck on the 4th data set that I was working on yesterday, but I have to really break it down step by step to get the results that I wanted. I was eventually able to get the right outcome and continue on with the rest of the data sets. I completed 4 more datasets today and since we have enough samples I am now working on combining the datasets. It has been difficult because every way that I have tried I am either losing data or it just isnt exactly what I am looking for, but I will continue to work on it to have it completed by tomorrow.
blockers: |
   My blocker for today was trying to complete the data cleaning and transposing on my fourth data set. I started working on it yesterday and it was just too fustrating to continue with, so I decided to take a break and start working on it again today. I had to take each step one by one and it basically took so almost 2 hours just to get the correct outcome, which was really fustrating.
   
reflection: |
  Overall, today was an accomplished day. I have been working on cleaning data sets all day. I have completed all of the data sets that Arpana has sent to me, so the next step is to complete the combining of the datasets to be used to train our model. I am now working on that and beginning the methodology section of our literature review. Today was another productive day for me and I will continue to work on combining the datasets without losing any data, so I can start training the model soon.
