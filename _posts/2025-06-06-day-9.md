what_i_learned: |
  Today we started out with a campus tour (I voted no) and it was cool to do. I usually do not go on any other part of campus except for the quad because that is where all of my classes are. I learned where the football field was and went into some new buildings. When we retruned to our labs we continued to work on on Python task that TJ assigned for us to do. We worked mainly on while loops today and utilizing not in if/else statements. I was already familiar with this but we had to integrate the use of True and False in some of our code for them to work and that has allowed me to have a better understanding of them. 

blockers: |
   My blockers for today were some of the task that we were assigned to code. I am mostly familiar with the conditionals, but sometimes I have difficulty altering a code to meet specific requirements without gaining errors. I was very confused when trying to implement True and False in one of my codes because it kept resulting in an infinite loop, but I eventually got the hang of it.
   
reflection: |
  Overall, today was a good day. Even though it was very hot I did enjoy the campus tour because it added on for my steps for the day. Once we came back to our labs we continued to work on Python task which I always appreciate. The more practice the better especially the way TJ does it. He always ask us to build on our code or alter it to meet another specific requirement which helps challenge us. We also started working on our video presentation in advance, so tomorrow we plan on doing the recording portion.
