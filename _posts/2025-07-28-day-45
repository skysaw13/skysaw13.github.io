what_i_learned: |
  Today, we started the day by attending a meeting with some tech guys from the university of alabama. After he talked to us and explained what they do we then were split up into 2 groups to go use the equipment that they brought for us to use. It was really cool and my favorite one was the headware and the drones. That was the most entertaining and it was pretty educational. After break we cam back to the lab and started discussing our slide ideas. We will continue to work on it more next week.

reflection: |
  Today, was a cool day. We had the opportunity to use some new machinery that allowed us to use our mind and muscles to move a little car and a drone. It was really entertaining and I did not expect to have so much fun doing it. We have started working on our slide and we plan to have them done by Tuesday hopefully. Next week is the last week of the program and I am excited for next Friday.
