  Today was another productive day. I was finally able to clean and properly combine all of the datasets that we found without losing majority of our data in the process. Doing it in a different order actually worked out in our favor. Since that part is complete I can now move forward with scaling our data. When using the .describe() method within the Pandas library I can see that the min and max values for each gene are highly seperated, so now I have using the Z-Score Normalization technique to scale the dataset to prevent genes with high raw values from overtaking within the PCA. The PCA helps guide the components with the most variations. I will be using these two to start the visualization of our datasets.

  Today, there were no blockers. I was able to successfully complete the combining of our datasets without losing majority of our data, which has been a huge problem for me these past 2 weeks. 
  
reflection: |
  Overall, today was a great day. I completed the combining of our datasets, which has been the hardest part of this whole process. I am so excited to move on to the machine learning algorithms because that part I am somewhat familiar with and that is when we get the good stuff like the visuals and the results. We were in the same room with group #12 and we were able to work on practice data science problems together which was cool (My group won of course). What made today even better is that Dr. Mack figured out why I could not see my check on GAD and now I can see it! I am looking forward to doing some more machine learning algorithms to see our results.
