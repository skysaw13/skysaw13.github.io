what_i_learned: |
  Today, I finished up our conclusion for our literature review. This one was a little more familiar for me as I have wrote several conclusions while doing my pysch major. My team finished up the finishing touches of the elevator pitch. Same is does videography in his spare time, so he is doing most of the editing since he likes doing stuff like that. Since we are mainly done with our literature review, we have started discussing our ideas for our presentation.

  Today, I have no blockers.
  
reflection: |
  Today, was another productive day. We have finished our conclusion part of the literature review, so this means we are mostly done. We just have to do some final adjustments and touchups and we shoud be good to go. We have also completed the finishing touches to finalize our elevator pitch to submit today. Since, we have made so much progress our focus will be strictly on completing the presentation slides for the final presentation.
