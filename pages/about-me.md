  bio: |
    I’m currently a senior studying Psychology and Computer Science at Morgan State University in Baltimore, Maryland. I expect to graduate in Fall 2026.
    
    I originally went to school to study psychology, but in my junior year I took an intro to computer science course and became highly interested, which encouraged me to become a double major and I have no regrets.
    
    When I’m not working or doing something related to school, I love to work out or do any type of physical activities, watch anime, spend time with my cat, or watch movies.
