what_i_learned: |
  Today we continued to try to increase of accuracy by trying several different machine learning algorithms, but the highest we got was about 80. We then proceeded to finish up our presentation slides for tomorrow's presentation. I do not believe we are doing the coding wrong I am pretty sure that we have to add more data to our overall data set so that we can train and test it more accurately. I am hoping we have luck finding more data as finding brain tumor datasets has been an ongoing problem for our group.

blockers: |
  Today, my blocker was trying to finish the presentation. We had majority of the slides already done last week, but we wanted to try to get better accuracy from our model to include that in our presentation, but we werent getting the results that we wanted, so I just decided to do our demo on what we have completed. 
  
reflection: |
  Overall, today was a bit more productive. We completed the presentatation while also working on trying to better our model accuracy. We werent able to improve it significantly so that will be our main focus next week. We went over our presentation to discuss who is doing what slide while making sure we know what we are explaining. I am nervous about tomorrow, but I am hoping that we are able to execute as practice regardless of the nerves.
