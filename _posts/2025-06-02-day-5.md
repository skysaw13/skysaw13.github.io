what_i_learned: |
  Today was our first day in person on campus. After, the introductions Dr. Waters had us participate in an activity to help us under how AI research is completed  y having us spilt up to either be a dependnent variable or a independent variable. She then proceeded to have us engage with her to explain how AI research is completed since AI is none deterministic. After lunch we went to our labs, where Dr. Paudel gave us an overview of what we would be doing this summer for our projects. He provided resources for us to read on and start to get a better understanding of our projects. So far I have learned how DNA and RNA/mRna connect to create the protein that allow us to function. We then proceeded to read about Brain tumors. There are 2 types of brain tumors and they are cancerous and noncancerous. There are also primary and metastatic brain tumors. Primary brain tumors are tumors that originate in the brain, while metastatic brain tumors originate in other parts of the body but end up spreading to the brain.

  I did not run into any challenges today, as it was just the introduction of the program and a bunch of reading for our project. 

reflection: |
  Overall, today has been another great day. I was happy to finally be in person and meet my group. I really enjoyed the independent and dependent variable activities that Dr. Waters had us do as it made us do some serious critical thinking. I also working with my group today in the lab and getting to know each other more. Dr. Paudel is highly knowledgable and I am really looking forward to working with him this Summer. My group topic is also something I am looking forward to doing as it somewhat has a relation to things that I have dealt with in my personal life.
