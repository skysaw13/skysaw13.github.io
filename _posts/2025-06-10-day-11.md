what_i_learned: |
  Today we continued to work on our machine learning videos. Some of the information we covered was how a gradient descent algorithm worked. I have learned about functions and derivatives before, but I am not the best in Math so it honestly felt like I was learning all over again. I did struggle a little bit while working on the derivatives, but I eventually caught on the how they work. TJ wants us to know the background of the code and not just run it but understand what is happening which I can really appreciate. We then started doing research for our literature review. Our target is to get a better understanding of genetic biomarkers that are associated with brain tumors. I have learned so much as far as just genreal facts about brain tumors like how their are 2 types of brain tumors, primary and metastatic. Primary brain tumors originate in the brain, while metastatic originate elsewhere in the body andn spread to the brain.

   I came across a few challenges today. My first one was during our literature review studying because when TJ was showing us how to actually obtain the data that we are going to use for the training and testing it looked like a bunch of random things and just trying to analyze it was fustrating me, but then he started to show us how to clean the data and remove unneccesary things to make it more readable. My next challenge was trying to figure our derivatives. Like I said before I am not the best at math, but TJ did a few practice problems with us and I eventually got the idea. 
   
reflection: |
  Overall, today was somewhat of a challenging day, but I am not mad about it. The past few days have been fairly easy to me as I was already familiar with a lot of the concepts. Now I am being challenged and I like that because that means I am learning more especially with the practice. I am looking forward to continuing learning more about machiine learning as I have realized I am starting to really enjoy it along with the data science. We have begun researching for the project's literature review and although I have done research and papers it has been a while so I am slowly remebering how these things work. I look forward to the weeks to come to see just how much progress weve made.
