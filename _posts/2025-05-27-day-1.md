what_i_learned: |
  To begin the orientation we went through a introduced ourselves with each other. We also played a game of bingo to help us interact and get to know each other. Then, Clyde went over what Git and Github is and he broke it down for us. He went over git commands such as git pull, git push, git add, etc. We then played a game of jeopardy to text our knowledge of what he taught us and team 2 won (my team)!

   For the first day there werent many challenges that I ran into. I would say my only challenge was during the bingo game trying to find someone that met someone famous and someone who has not flown on a plane.
   
reflection: |
  Overall the first day of orientation was great and very entertaining! I was already familar with Git, GitHub, and the commands, so it was more of a review for me. I just really enjoyed the Bingo and Jeopardy games. It made the first day pretty memorable. I also was able to meet my group members.
