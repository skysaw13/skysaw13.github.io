what_i_learned: |
    Today, was a pretty busy day. This week we have been highly focused on getting a jump on our project, so these past two days we have been working super hard on the start of our project. I have been delegated to handle the data cleaning as well as transposing the data. I will admit it was very hard for me at first because I did not understand what I was looking at and every time I would try to attempt something the results were incorrect or just not what I was doing, but TJ has been a great help and now I am feeling more comfortable with doing these task. I am basically responsible for the methodology portion of out literature review and I have never done anthing so serious, but I am learning as I go.
blockers: |
   My blocker for today was cleaning and transposing the data for our model. It is a tedious and sometimes annoying task. I get fustrated because it seems like such an easy thing to do, but there is so much data there is no quick way to complete the cleaning. Sometimes I can handle things on excel, but then sometimes I have to load everything up onto a csv file and fix things by coding. 
   
reflection: |
  Overall, today was a busy day. We have been working so hard all day that the time completely flew today. I will admit I havent been this fustrated during the internship as I was today, but that only means that I am learning and gaining more experience. I try to put a positive spin on it, but cleaning data is way harder than I thought it would be. I am happy from the progress that we have made this week. I felt like we were getting a little behind, but the task and videos that TJ has assigned to us for the first few weeks has helped me significantly be prepared for this. I look forward to seeing how much more progress we make next week.
