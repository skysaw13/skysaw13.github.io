what_i_learned: |
  Today, we worked again on our presentation slides. We finished any additional fixes and I completed the voice demo for the slides. We practiced how we would present and basically spent the whole day doing that. They are looking great.

  Today, I have no blockers.
  
reflection: |
  Today, we completed our presentation slides. I did the video demo and it was fairly easy to complete within 3 minutes. I hope we have enough time because we have a good amount of slides. I am looking forward to doing the presentation and showing what we have done.
