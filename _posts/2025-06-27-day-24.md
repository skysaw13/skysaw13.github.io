what_i_learned: |
  Today I started off by making sure all of my previos code from yesterday was working and giving me my comparison results (Original data and the scaled data). Once, I was sure that was good I then went on to start finding models to begin my feature selection. I tried a variety of feature selection methods, but the first few just did not work well with my dataset. They either did not give me the accurate results or the run time was so long it was wasting too much of my time. I tried Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (MRMR), and a few others, but none of them worked well. I discovered Pearson’s correlation coefficient which has been working well so far and now I am using another method called Spearman to compare with my Pearson's analysis.

blockers: |
  Today, my blocker was trying to find the right feature selection method that would help analyze my data. I tried a few today, but majority of them did mot work or the run time was insanely long. I eventually found one that works and I will continue to build off of that.
  
reflection: |
  Overall, today was an okay day. I did struggle a lot in the beginning of the work day because I did not have any luck finding a compatible method to do feature selection on my data. My goal was to try to find which genes were express the most based on my data, but it fairly difficult to find the right method. I eventually found a method that works with my data set and is getting me the right results that I am looking for. I will continue to build off of this to maintain my data.
