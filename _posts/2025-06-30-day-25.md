what_i_learned: |
  Today we started off by reading through a few articles and watching some machine learning videos to help us figure our which methods/models would be best to execute our project. Dr. Paudel sent us a few articles and videos over the weekend for us to review that could help guide us. We have been having a hard time getting this part of the project going so this really helped us out. We have started to go in a different direction now and it seems to be working. We have used Decision Trees and Random Forest to train and test our models, but we will continue to try different methods to get better results.

blockers: |
  Today, my blocker was trying to find the right algorithm that would give me the best results as far as my classification report. The results have not been high enough and they are inconsistent, so we have been trying to different methods to solve this problem.
  
reflection: |
  Overall, today was an okay day. The progress was not as significant as I wanted it to be but there was still some progress. We need to do better as far as gaining consistency across all folds in the classification report. It has been pretty fustrating but we will push through.
