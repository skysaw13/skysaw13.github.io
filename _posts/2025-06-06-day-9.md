what_i_learned: |
  Today we started out completing several Python task that TJ gave us. We did problmes that implememted removing items from a list, adding items to a list, sorting through a list, and many more. We also started to discuss matrices and the difference between a vector and a scalar. Vector have both magnitude and direction, while scalars only have magnitude and they are both used in AI and ML. 

blockers: |
   I did not have any blockers today because I was familiar with the concepts that we worked on today. Most of them that we worked on today were concepts Michael went over with us in Python 102. 
   
reflection: |
  Overall, today was another good day. We worked on a lot of Python coding and like I always say the more practice for me the better. We went over vectors and scalars which I have not really worked on in a while, so that was a nice refresher. We completed our first video presentation for week 2 and I really enjoyed doing that with my team as it was cool to see everyone's differences as far as the challenged that they encountered during the week. I look forward the next week because this is when it will become a bit more challenging for me. This was a great week of learning and practicing Python!
