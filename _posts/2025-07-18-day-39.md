what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued to work finish our methodology outline. I am sure we can have some more improvements, but we will look more into it once we fully complete the outline of the entire literature review. I have started working on the results outline as well. I am having a hard time because it is hard to properly structure it even with references, but I will continue to work on it. The coding is done for the most part thankfully, but if needed we will update it as needed. 

blockers: |
  Today, my only blocker is properly structuring my result section. I want to make sure it is made correctly, but it has been pretty difficult.
  
reflection: |
  Today, was an okay day. I finally completed the outline of the methodology and I have began to work on the results outline. It has been giving me a little bit of a hard time, but I will continue to work on it because I want this to be over so we can finish the overall review. We will continue to work on this as well as complete research on relevant genes.
