what_i_learned: |
  Today for the most part we worked on the same stuff as yesterday, which is learning more about Machine Learning/Data Science and researching for our literature review. Today I worked more with Random Forest Regressor and how to fit and predict a model using the train_x and train_y. I am familiar with it but it is great review as I needed a refresher. I have also been learning about "Mean Absolute Error (MSE)", which is formula that calculates the average magnitude between the differences of the predicted value and the actual value. During my literature review research I came across several genetic biomarkers that help identify brain tumors such as mutations in the IDH1 and IDH2, TERT promoter mutations, and more.

   The one thing that gave me a bit of a challenge today was during our research trying to look through methodologies was a bit difficult as majority of them did not necessarily break down the steps they took to get the result that they got. I will continue to look to find more options. 
   
reflection: |
  Overall, today was another great learning day. Data science and machine learning is beginning to have a very positive affect on me. I can see myself pursuing this in the future. I just want to be able to find more research on how our group can execute the coding effectively, so we can have a great outcome. TJ makes it interesting by keeping us on our toes and quizzing us to make sure that we are retaining the information.
