what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked more on the results section of our literature review by adding more information and visuals to fully demonstrate the outcome. I was able to complete the results and start adding the additional sections like the discussion and conslusion. Since I was able to finish the results I want to go back over my work to make sure everything is thoroughly explained and make sure that there are no grammatic errors. Once my team members start adding to our discussion I can complete our conclusion section.

blockers: |
  Today, I have no blockers.
  
reflection: |
  Today, was a productive day. I was able to complete our results section so now that is done and the methodology. I created the additional sections like the discussion and the conclusion, but I cannot start working on it until my group members start the discussion portion. I hope we are able to have the literature review done by the end of the week. We also have to start on our elevator pitch which I am looking forward to completing.
