what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued to work on our methodology. It is a work in progress and I have been making significant progress. I am almost done and once I finish we will move on to starting the results/conclusion section of the literature review. We had another writing session with the writing center which was pretty informative, but I am already pretty familiar with the concepts that they were teaching us about.

blockers: |
  Today, there weren't any other blockers.
  
reflection: |
  Today, was a productive day. I was consumed with finishing up the methodology once we returned from break. I am about 75% done, but I want to complete it by the end of tomorrow which I know I can do. The writing center spoke with us again today and it was informative. We played kahoot and I came in 7th place because I got 1 question wrong unfortunately. I am looking forward to starting to work on the resuts. We are almost done and I cant wait!
