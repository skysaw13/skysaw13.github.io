what_i_learned: |
  Today was a productive day. I did clean a bunch of data sets and I combined them. I thought I was making good progress, but once all combined and cleaned up I lost a good amount of data, so we had to try a different route. So, now instead of cleaning and organizing the datasets I am going through transposing the datasets and then going to combine the datasets instead. I will combine the datasets and then clean them up by identifying the ID_Ref with its ENSG gene and then going to match it with its corresponding gene expression.

  The blocker for today was losing so much data during the combination of the datasets. To try to solve this problem TJ and I decided to try to combine the original datasets first instead of cleaning them all first. I am hoping that this fixes the problem, so that we can start on the modeling process.
  
reflection: |
  Overall, today was a pretty productive day. I have become pretty familiar with the cleaning and transposing process of the datasets so things are moving a little faster. My group members have found the RIGHT datasets this time, so now we are just on the roll. I am trying to see if this new process will help us keep a good majority of our data. It is crunch time now, so I am really hoping that this works because we have to really make some more progress to start on our presentation thats on Friday.
