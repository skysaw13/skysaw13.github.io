what_i_learned: |
  To begin today we were introduced to the graduate mentors and the faculty members that will be with us throughout the internship. My project group met with our graduate mentor ,TJ, and he breifly discussed some concepts that we would be using such as machine learning, linear regression, etc. We then went on to continue creating our website. I also volunteered to assist undergraduates that needed additional assistance setting up their website with Sumit. Then, we broke off into 2 groups depending on your placement for python and for Python102 we went over list, sets, and dictionaries and completed somewhat of a assignment to check our knowledge. 
  

blockers: |
  I would say my only challenge for today was trying to help people fix their issues while setting up their websites because we werent able to share screens.
  
reflection: |
  So far today has been more so an introduction to the mentors and faculty. Michael went over list, dictionaries, and sets with us and it was a great refresher since I was already familiar with these. We ended the class playing heads up which was a nice interaction game.
