what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued to work on our code. Unfortunately, we have gotten to a point where we do not believe our accuracy will increase any further, so now I am basically creating our visualizations for our project such as bar plots, heatmaps, etc. We are also continuing our work on our literature review. Since I am basically finished with the code I have added the remain methods to our methodology. Sam and Ato have been working hard on our Introduction and they are almost complete. 

blockers: |
  Today, there weren't any other blockers.
  
reflection: |
  Today, was a productive day. I have completed the code for the most part, so now its just a matter of getting the literature review done. We are still doing research to back up our findings as well as verify a few things. I am happy that we are almost finished this. It has been a fustrating process, but a grea learning process.
