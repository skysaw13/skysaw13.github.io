what_i_learned: |
  Today, we went to the business building and learned about VARK and Myer's Briggs test. I was familiar with the Myer's Briggs test, but it was cool seeing everyone's different styles and personalities. When we came back to the lab we continues to work on bettering our accuracy. We decided to try a different approach by using CPM normalization. We are seeing some good progress.

  Today, there werent any other blockers today.
  
reflection: |
  Today, was an okay day. The cohort was pretty cool and interesting to see the different personalities. Jelani and I won bingo, and our prize was to come up and help the instructor read the slides unfortunately. I hate presenting in front of people. We made some decent progress today so I am happy.
