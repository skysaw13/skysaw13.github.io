  Today we jumped back into looking for more data. We have a little over 700 samples, but we ideally want to have over 1,000. Arpana found some more data for me last night, and it had a good amount of samples, so I added that to our overall dataset, which finally put us over 1000 samples. Now, we are just trying to figure out the best model to use to obtain the best accuracy.

  Today, my only blocker has been trying to find the best model to use to get the best accuracy. We found more data to add to our overall total which has put us over 1000 samples, but the accuracy's are still not as high as we would like them to be. We will continue to work on it though.

  Overall, today was an okay. Arpana was able to find more data for me to add to our overall dataset which put us over 1000. It has been difficult finding the right data, but we finally found it. Now we just have to find the best model to use that will give us the highest accuracy. I am trying my best to not get discouraged, but even with the additional data we are still barely getting pass 80 for our accuracy no matter ho much tweaking we do.
