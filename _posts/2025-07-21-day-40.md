what_i_learned: |
  Today, we gathered in the business building to go over some overleaf topics, which I thought I didn't need. It ended up being very useful. We worked on adding our work to our overleaf and after break we returned to our labs. Once back in the labs I continued to work on the results section of our literature review by writing and adding the visuals. I did have to critique some of my methodology, but it wasnt too bad.

  Today, I had no blockers.
  
reflection: |
  Today, was an okay day. Dr. Mack talked to us about our elevator pitch and what we will be doing on our last day of CEAMLS. The elevator pitch does not seem too bad and I am happy we are doing something fun for our last day. I have never been to this place, so it should be fun. We are making pretty good progress on our literature review and we are almost done for the most part, which I am so happy about. With the addition of visuals and the results of our project I am feeling pretty good about our progress.
