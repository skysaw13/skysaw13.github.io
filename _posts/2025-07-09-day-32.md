  Today, we jumped right into identifying what model would be best for our predictions. Since we now have over 1000 samples in our dataset we feel much more confident in trying to find the best model that will give us the best accuracy. This morning TJ went over a few techniques, graphs, and just overall knowledge that we should know to move on which was very informative. We did not have much luck with getting higher accuracy until about 11 am when I decided to change my filterization method from low-expression to usng t-test which made a significant improvement. I used this and a the random forest model which resulted in me finally getting past 80 to get an 81. From there I have just continued to tune my parameters, but I have not had much luck yet, but I will continue to work on it.

  Today, my only blocker has been trying to find the best model to use to get the best accuracy. With the increase in our overall dataset I have much more confidence.

  Overall, today was great day. Since we have over 1000 samples of data we have much more confidence and determination to obtain a higher accuracy. So far I have been able to achieve an accuracy of 81 with the LightGBM and Random Forest models which has been a great improvement. I will continue to test out different models to try to find the best accuarcy.
