what_i_learned: |
  Today, our group finished our discussion and we started working on our conclusion. We are almost done thankfully. We have started creating our elevator pitch and I am really excited about our idea. I believe we have a really good idea and it is very unique. I look forward to everyone seeing it.

reflection: |
  Today, was a productive day. We have finished our disscusion part of the literature review and we have started on our conclusion. The progress has been great! We started our video and its going to be so good after editing. We have a unique idea and I think itll be a very interesting and funny video for everyone to see.
