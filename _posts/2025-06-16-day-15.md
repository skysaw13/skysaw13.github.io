what_i_learned: |
    Today, was another busy day. I came in and got right back into cleaning the data that Arpana was collecting for me. I was able to clean 3 datasets today which honestly impressed me. I am currently working on my fourth dataset, but this one has been a little tough because I have to transcribe the gene id that was originally on the dataset to match its "ENSG" gene. Once I do that I have to then basically translate the "ENSG" gene to match its gene expression which has been very tedious and challenging. I have become more accustomed to transposing the data, but cleaning the data has been the hardest part of the task becaue some of them are simple, but other ones take a little more time and can be challenging.

   My blocker for today is this fourth dataset that I am trying to clean. I have to basically translate the gene id with the accurate gene expression to be use in our training model, but I have not been able to figure out how to do this, but I will continue to work on it because I need to move on the the next group of datasets.
   
reflection: |
  Overall, today was another busy day. I have been very busy working on cleaning and transposing the data that Arpana has been collecting for me. I feel really good about today because I was able to complete 3 whole datasets confidently. I am happy that I was able to get a hang of it as I was getting fustrated a lot last week because I just could not understand what I was looking at or what needed to be done. I feel really good about our progress and I am looking forward to see how much further we get by the end of the week.
